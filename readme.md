# Youssef Land Terminal
Welcome to Youssef Land! In this "_bashy_" part of Youssef Land we are referencing __Youssef Land Terminal__! So, on this project, we are including "iostream" for its functions of C++. We used "string" as well. (__[Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview), later [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs)__ was used.) Whenever you need keyboard instructions, well, here we go!

## Overview
So, we have things to finish this project up, like:

- [x] making a character array;
- [ ] getting into directories __`(FAILED!)`__;
- [x] making commands to __kill__ the project;
- [x] making while loops;
- [x] making functions; 
- [x] making bash errors;
- [x] making bash warnings;
- [x] making a command called `help` for helping people become experts at terminals.
