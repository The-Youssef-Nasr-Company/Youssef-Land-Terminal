# Youssef Land Terminal

Welcome to Youssef Land! In this "_bashy_" part of Youssef Land we are referencing __Youssef Land Terminal__! So, on this project, we are including "iostream" for its functions of C++. We used "string" as well. (__[Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview)__ was used.) Whenever you need keyboard instructions, well, here we go!

## Overview

So, we have things to finish this project up, like:

- [x] making a character array
- [ ] getting into directories __`(FAILED!)`__
- [x] making commands to __kill__ the project
- [x] making "while" functions
- [x] making functions 
- [x] making bash errors
- [ ] making bash warnings
- [x] making a command called `help` for helping people become experts at terminals


There's something REALLY helpful.
