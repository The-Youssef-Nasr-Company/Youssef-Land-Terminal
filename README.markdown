# Youssef Land Terminal

Welcome to Youssef Land! In this "_bashy_" part of Youssef Land we are referencing __Youssef Land Terminal__! So, on this project, we are including "iostream" for its functions of C++. We used "string" as well. (__[Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview)__ was used.)
